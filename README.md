## 🧠 About Me
I am a software engineer and researcher specializing in:
- Climate data analysis & risk modeling  
- Deep learning (CNNs, U-Net, LSTMs)  
- Computer vision & geospatial processing  
- Backend engineering (Python, Flask, Node.js, NestJS)  
- Cloud systems (GCP, Docker)  
- Optimization with **Google OR-Tools**

I enjoy solving hard problems using AI, especially in domains where technology directly impacts lives — climate adaptation, infrastructure safety, and smart automation.
